## Pull Request

All contributions to the OpenFeature project are welcome via GitHub pull requests.

To create a new PR, you will need to first fork the GitHub repository and clone upstream.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk.git openfeature-dotnet-sdk
```

Navigate to the repository folder
```bash
cd openfeature-dotnet-sdk
```

Add your fork as an origin
```bash
git remote add fork https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/dotnet-sdk.git
```

To start working on a new feature or bugfix, create a new branch and start working on it.

```bash
git checkout -b feat/NAME_OF_FEATURE
# Make your changes
git commit
git push fork feat/NAME_OF_FEATURE
```

Open a pull request against the main dotnet-sdk repository.

### Running tests locally

#### Unit tests

To run unit tests execute:

```bash
dotnet test test/OpenFeature.Tests/
```

#### E2E tests

To be able to run the e2e tests, first we need to initialize the submodule and copy the test files:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive && cp test-harness/features/evaluation.feature test/OpenFeature.E2ETests/Features/
```

Afterwards, you need to start flagd locally:

```bash
docker run -p 8013:8013 ghcr.io/open-feature/flagd-testbed:latest
```

Now you can run the tests using:

```bash
dotnet test test/OpenFeature.E2ETests/
```

### How to Receive Comments

* If the PR is not ready for review, please mark it as
  [`draft`](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/).
* Make sure all required CI checks are clear.
* Submit small, focused PRs addressing a single concern/issue.
* Make sure the PR title reflects the contribution.
* Write a summary that helps understand the change.
* Include usage examples in the summary, where applicable.

### How to Get PRs Merged

A PR is considered to be **ready to merge** when:

* Major feedbacks are resolved.
* It has been open for review for at least one working day. This gives people
  reasonable time to review.
* Trivial change (typo, cosmetic, doc, etc.) doesn't have to wait for one day.
* Urgent fix can take exception as long as it has been actively communicated.

Any Maintainer can merge the PR once it is **ready to merge**. Note, that some
PRs may not be merged immediately if the repo is in the process of a release and
the maintainers decided to defer the PR to the next release train.

If a PR has been stuck (e.g. there are lots of debates and people couldn't agree
on each other), the owner should try to get people aligned by:

* Consolidating the perspectives and putting a summary in the PR. It is
  recommended to add a link into the PR description, which points to a comment
  with a summary in the PR conversation.
* Tagging subdomain experts (by looking at the change history) in the PR asking
  for suggestion.
* Reaching out to more people on the [CNCF OpenFeature Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C0344AANLA1).
* Stepping back to see if it makes sense to narrow down the scope of the PR or
  split it up.
* If none of the above worked and the PR has been stuck for more than 2 weeks,
  the owner should bring it to the OpenFeatures [meeting](README.md#contributing).

## Automated Changelog

Each time a release is published the changelogs will be generated automatically using [dotnet-releaser](https://github.com/xoofx/dotnet-releaser/blob/main/doc/changelog_user_guide.md#13-categories). The tool will organise the changes based on the PR labels.

## Design Choices

As with other OpenFeature SDKs, dotnet-sdk follows the
[openfeature-specification](https://github.com/open-feature/spec).

## Style Guide

This project includes a [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) file which is
supported by all the IDEs/editor mentioned above. It works with the IDE/editor
only and does not affect the actual build of the project.

## Benchmarking

We use [BenchmarkDotNet](https://benchmarkdotnet.org/articles/overview.html) NuGet package to benchmark a code.

To run pipelines locally, you can follow these commands from a root project directory.

```
dotnet restore
dotnet build --configuration Release --output "./release" --no-restore
dotnet release/OpenFeature.Benchmarks.dll
```

## Consuming pre-release packages

1. Acquire a [GitHub personal access token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) scoped for `read:packages` and verify the permissions:
   ```console
   $ gh auth login --scopes read:packages

   ? What account do you want to log into? GitHub.com
   ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? HTTPS
   ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? Login with a web browser

   ! First copy your one-time code: ****-****
   Press Enter to open github.com in your browser...

   ‚úì Authentication complete.
   - gh config set -h github.com git_protocol https
   ‚úì Configured git protocol
   ‚úì Logged in as ********
   ```

   ```console
   $ gh auth status

   github.com
     ‚úì Logged in to github.com as ******** (~/.config/gh/hosts.yml)
     ‚úì Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol.
     ‚úì Token: gho_************************************
     ‚úì Token scopes: gist, read:org, read:packages, repo, workflow
   ```
2. Run the following command to configure your local environment to consume packages from GitHub Packages:
   ```console
   $ dotnet nuget update source github-open-feature --username $(gh api user --jq .email) --password $(gh auth token) --store-password-in-clear-text

   Package source "github-open-feature" was successfully updated.
   ```
