OpenFeature is an open standard for feature flag management, created to support a robust feature flag ecosystem using cloud native technologies. OpenFeature will provide a unified API and SDK, and a developer-first, cloud-native implementation, with extensibility for open source and commercial offerings.

## Supported .Net Versions

The packages will aim to support all current .NET versions. Refer to the currently supported versions [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) and [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) Excluding .NET Framework 3.5

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```csharp
using OpenFeatureSDK;

// Sets the provider used by the client
OpenFeature.Instance.SetProvider(new NoOpProvider());
// Gets a instance of the feature flag client
var client = OpenFeature.Instance.GetClient();
// Evaluation the `my-feature` feature flag
var isEnabled = await client.GetBooleanValue("my-feature", false);
```

### Provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency. This can be a new repository or included in an existing contrib repository available under the OpenFeature organization. Finally, youâ€™ll then need to write the provider itself. In most languages, this can be accomplished by implementing the provider interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

Example of implementing a feature flag provider

```csharp
using OpenFeatureSDK;
using OpenFeatureSDK.Model;

public class MyFeatureProvider : FeatureProvider
{
    public static string Name => "My Feature Provider";

    public Metadata GetMetadata()
    {
        return new Metadata(Name);
    }

    public Task<ResolutionDetails<bool>> ResolveBooleanValue(string flagKey, bool defaultValue,
        EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // code to resolve boolean details
    }

    public Task<ResolutionDetails<string>> ResolveStringValue(string flagKey, string defaultValue,
        EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // code to resolve string details
    }

    public Task<ResolutionDetails<int>> ResolveIntegerValue(string flagKey, int defaultValue,
        EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // code to resolve integer details
    }

    public Task<ResolutionDetails<double>> ResolveDoubleValue(string flagKey, double defaultValue,
        EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // code to resolve integer details
    }

    public Task<ResolutionDetails<T>> ResolveStructureValue<T>(string flagKey, T defaultValue,
        EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // code to resolve object details
    }
}
```

### Hook

Hooks are a mechanism that allow for the addition of arbitrary behavior at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle. Use cases include validation of the resolved flag value, modifying or adding data to the evaluation context, logging, telemetry, and tracking.

Example of adding a hook

```csharp
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
openFeature.AddHooks(new ExampleGlobalHook());

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
var client = OpenFeature.Instance.GetClient();
client.AddHooks(new ExampleClientHook());

// add a hook for this evaluation only
var value = await client.GetBooleanValue("boolFlag", false, context, new FlagEvaluationOptions(new ExampleInvocationHook()));
```

Example of implementing a hook

```csharp
public class MyHook : Hook
{
  public Task<EvaluationContext> Before<T>(HookContext<T> context,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run before flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task After<T>(HookContext<T> context, FlagEvaluationDetails<T> details,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run after successful flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task Error<T>(HookContext<T> context, Exception error,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run if there's an error during before hooks or during flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task Finally<T>(HookContext<T> context, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run after all other stages, regardless of success/failure
  }
}
```
