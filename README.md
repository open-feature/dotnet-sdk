[OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev) is an open specification that provides a vendor-agnostic, community-driven API for feature flagging that works with your favorite feature flag management tool.

<!-- x-hide-in-docs-end -->

## üöÄ Quick start

### Requirements

-   .NET 6+
-   .NET Core 6+
-   .NET Framework 4.6.2+

Note that the packages will aim to support all current .NET versions. Refer to the currently supported versions [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) and [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) excluding .NET Framework 3.5

### Install

Use the following to initialize your project:

```sh
dotnet new console
```

and install OpenFeature:

```sh
dotnet add package OpenFeature
```

### Usage

```csharp
public async Task Example()
{
    // Register your feature flag provider
    await Api.Instance.SetProvider(new InMemoryProvider());

    // Create a new client
    FeatureClient client = Api.Instance.GetClient();

    // Evaluate your feature flag
    bool v2Enabled = await client.GetBooleanValue("v2_enabled", false);

    if ( v2Enabled )
    {
        //Do some work
    }
}
```

### Providers

[Providers](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/provider) are an abstraction between a flag management system and the OpenFeature SDK.
Here is [a complete list of available providers](https://openfeature.dev/ecosystem?instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btype%5D%5B0%5D=Provider&instant_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Btechnology%5D%5B0%5D=.NET).

If the provider you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a provider](#develop-a-provider) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a provider as a dependency, it can be registered with OpenFeature like this:

```csharp
await Api.Instance.SetProvider(new MyProvider());
```

In some situations, it may be beneficial to register multiple providers in the same application.
This is possible using [named clients](#named-clients), which is covered in more detail below.

### Targeting

Sometimes, the value of a flag must consider some dynamic criteria about the application or user such as the user's location, IP, email address, or the server's location.
In OpenFeature, we refer to this as [targeting](https://openfeature.dev/specification/glossary#targeting).
If the flag management system you're using supports targeting, you can provide the input data using the [evaluation context](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/evaluation-context).

```csharp
// set a value to the global context
EvaluationContextBuilder builder = EvaluationContext.Builder();
builder.Set("region", "us-east-1");
EvaluationContext apiCtx = builder.Build();
Api.Instance.SetContext(apiCtx);

// set a value to the client context
builder = EvaluationContext.Builder();
builder.Set("region", "us-east-1");
EvaluationContext clientCtx = builder.Build();
var client = Api.Instance.GetClient();
client.SetContext(clientCtx);

// set a value to the invocation context
builder = EvaluationContext.Builder();
builder.Set("region", "us-east-1");
EvaluationContext reqCtx = builder.Build();

bool flagValue = await client.GetBooleanValue("some-flag", false, reqCtx);

```

### Hooks

[Hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/concepts/hooks) allow for custom logic to be added at well-defined points of the flag evaluation life-cycle.
Here is [a complete list of available hooks](https://openfeature.dev/docs/reference/technologies/server/dotnet/).
If the hook you're looking for hasn't been created yet, see the [develop a hook](#develop-a-hook) section to learn how to build it yourself.

Once you've added a hook as a dependency, it can be registered at the global, client, or flag invocation level.

```csharp
// add a hook globally, to run on all evaluations
Api.Instance.AddHooks(new ExampleGlobalHook());

// add a hook on this client, to run on all evaluations made by this client
var client = Api.Instance.GetClient();
client.AddHooks(new ExampleClientHook());

// add a hook for this evaluation only
var value = await client.GetBooleanValue("boolFlag", false, context, new FlagEvaluationOptions(new ExampleInvocationHook()));
```

### Logging

The .NET SDK uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. See the [manual](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging?tabs=command-line) for complete documentation.

### Named clients

Clients can be given a name.
A name is a logical identifier that can be used to associate clients with a particular provider.
If a name has no associated provider, the global provider is used.

```csharp
// registering the default provider
await Api.Instance.SetProvider(new LocalProvider());

// registering a named provider
await Api.Instance.SetProvider("clientForCache", new CachedProvider());

// a client backed by default provider
FeatureClient clientDefault = Api.Instance.GetClient();

// a client backed by CachedProvider
FeatureClient clientNamed = Api.Instance.GetClient("clientForCache");

```

### Eventing

Events are currently not supported by the .NET SDK. Progress on this feature can be tracked [here](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk/issues/126).

### Shutdown

The OpenFeature API provides a close function to perform a cleanup of all registered providers. This should only be called when your application is in the process of shutting down.

```csharp
// Shut down all providers
await Api.Instance.Shutdown();
```

## Extending

### Develop a provider

To develop a provider, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
You‚Äôll then need to write the provider by implementing the `FeatureProvider` interface exported by the OpenFeature SDK.

```csharp
public class MyProvider : FeatureProvider
{
    public override Metadata GetMetadata()
    {
        return new Metadata("My Provider");
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<bool>> ResolveBooleanValue(string flagKey, bool defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve a boolean flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<double>> ResolveDoubleValue(string flagKey, double defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve a double flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<int>> ResolveIntegerValue(string flagKey, int defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve an int flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<string>> ResolveStringValue(string flagKey, string defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve a string flag value
    }

    public override Task<ResolutionDetails<Value>> ResolveStructureValue(string flagKey, Value defaultValue, EvaluationContext context = null)
    {
        // resolve an object flag value
    }
}
```

### Develop a hook

To develop a hook, you need to create a new project and include the OpenFeature SDK as a dependency.
This can be a new repository or included in [the existing contrib repository](https://github.com/open-feature/dotnet-sdk-contrib) available under the OpenFeature organization.
Implement your own hook by conforming to the `Hook interface`.
To satisfy the interface, all methods (`Before`/`After`/`Finally`/`Error`) need to be defined.

```csharp
public class MyHook : Hook
{
  public Task<EvaluationContext> Before<T>(HookContext<T> context,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run before flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task After<T>(HookContext<T> context, FlagEvaluationDetails<T> details,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run after successful flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task Error<T>(HookContext<T> context, Exception error,
      IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run if there's an error during before hooks or during flag evaluation
  }

  public virtual Task Finally<T>(HookContext<T> context, IReadOnlyDictionary<string, object> hints = null)
  {
    // code to run after all other stages, regardless of success/failure
  }
}
```
